        <h2>Role of the While Loop in the Game</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Continuous Game Execution:</strong> The while loop ensures that the game keeps running continuously while the running variable remains true. This loop allows the game to update and respond to user input in real-time.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Event Handling:</strong> Inside the while loop, events such as key presses and touch events are continuously monitored. This allows the game to detect when the player interacts with the game, such as pressing the spacebar to make the ball jump or touching the screen on a mobile device.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Game Logic Execution:</strong> The game logic, including updating the ball's position, detecting collisions, and managing game over conditions, is executed within the while loop. This ensures that the game behaves as intended and responds accurately to user actions.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Rendering:</strong> The while loop also controls the rendering of the game graphics. It continuously updates the display to reflect the current state of the game, including the position of the ball, the black line, and any other visual elements.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Game Flow Management:</strong> The while loop governs the overall flow of the game, transitioning between different states such as gameplay, game over, and restarting the game. It ensures that the game progresses smoothly and provides a seamless user experience.
            </li>
